# Uber_Data-Analysis

This is a data visualization project with ggplot2 where we’ll use R and its libraries and analyze various parameters like trips by the hours in a day and trips during months in a year. We’ll use the Uber Pickups in New York City dataset and create visualizations for different time-frames of the year.
